  <p id="advantages"> <h2>HTML Advantages</h2>
    Almost – if not all – browsers support HTML. Certainly more browsers support HTML than any other web programming language. As a result, when you build a website using HTML, it would show up on most browsers around the world, as long as the
    programmer takes care to optimize the website for the most commonly used browsers.
    Optimizing an HTML based website for browser compatibility is neither difficult nor complex.
